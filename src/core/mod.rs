// Module-level comments
//! # Core Logic Module
//!
//! This module (`core/mod.rs`) serves as the central hub for the application's
//! core business logic. It re-exports and organizes functionalities from its submodules:
//!
//! - `cache`: Handles caching mechanisms, likely for CODEOWNERS data or other processed information.
//! - `commands`: Contains the implementations for the various CLI commands.
//! - `common`: Provides shared utilities or data structures used across the core module.
//! - `parse`: Implements parsing logic, especially for CODEOWNERS files.
//! - `types`: Defines core data types and structures used throughout the application.

/// Placeholder function, currently does nothing.
///
/// This function is intended to be an entry point or initialization routine for
/// core functionalities, but it is not yet implemented.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` indicating successful execution (though it performs no actions).
pub fn start() -> Result<()> {
    // does nothing

    Ok(())
}
